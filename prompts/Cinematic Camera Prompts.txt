# Cinematic Camera Prompts for Stable Diffusion

## Distance & Framing Prompts
- `extreme wide shot`, `establishing shot` - Shows entire scene/location from far distance
- `wide shot`, `long shot` - Shows full subject with plenty of surrounding environment
- `full shot` - Shows entire subject from head to toe
- `medium long shot`, `3/4 shot` - Shows subject from knees up
- `medium shot` - Shows subject from waist up
- `medium close-up` - Shows subject from chest up
- `close-up` - Shows subject's face/head only
- `extreme close-up` - Shows detail or single feature (eyes, lips, etc.)

## Angle Prompts
- `eye level shot` - Camera at subject's eye level, neutral perspective
- `low angle shot` - Camera looking up at subject, creates power/dominance
- `high angle shot` - Camera looking down at subject, creates vulnerability
- `dutch angle`, `tilted shot` - Camera rotated, horizon at angle
- `bird's eye view`, `overhead shot` - Camera directly above looking down
- `worm's eye view` - Camera at ground level looking up

## Character Framing Prompts
- `over the shoulder shot` - Shot from behind one subject looking at another
- `two shot` - Two subjects in same frame
- `three shot` - Three subjects in same frame
- `group shot` - Multiple subjects in frame
- `single shot` - One subject only
- `reaction shot` - Subject's emotional response
- `point of view shot`, `pov shot` - Through character's eyes

## Movement & Technical Prompts
- `tracking shot` - Camera follows moving subject
- `dolly shot` - Camera moves toward/away from subject
- `zoom shot` - Lens zooms in/out on subject
- `master shot` - Wide shot showing all elements of scene
- `insert shot`, `cutaway` - Close detail of specific object/action

## Combinations & Modifiers
Add these to enhance your prompts:
- Lens: `shot on 35mm`, `telephoto lens`, `wide angle lens`
- Lighting: `cinematic lighting`, `dramatic lighting`, `natural lighting`
- Style: `film grain`, `movie still`, `cinematic composition`
- Quality: `4k`, `8k`, `high definition`, `professional photography`

## Example Prompts
1. Dramatic portrait: `close-up shot, dramatic lighting, low angle shot, cinematic composition`
2. Establishing scene: `extreme wide shot, bird's eye view, cinematic lighting, 8k`
3. Action sequence: `medium shot, dutch angle, dramatic lighting, motion blur`
4. Emotional moment: `medium close-up, eye level shot, natural lighting, film grain`

## Tips for Usage
1. Combine camera distances with angles for more specific results
2. Add lighting and style modifiers to enhance cinematic feel
3. Use movement prompts sparingly as they can be harder to generate
4. Consider emotional impact when choosing angles
5. Start with basic shots before experimenting with complex combinations
